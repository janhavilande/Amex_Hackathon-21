# Amex_Hackathon-21
This is the source code to Amex- Techgig Geek Goddess 2021. 

We are given the data of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (target variable y). The task is to implement a Bank Term Deposit Scheme. The technique is phone calling the clients, getting their details and letting them know about the different schemes. The data sets are provided with the details of the campaign to train our model. 
The purpose of the hackathon is to build a model which would predict if the client will say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for the scheme.
